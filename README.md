# Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the marks scored by a student using the simple linear regression model.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Load the dataset into a DataFrame and explore its contents to understand the data structure.
2.Separate the dataset into independent (X) and dependent (Y) variables, and split them into training and testing sets.
3.Create a linear regression model and fit it using the training data.
4.Predict the results for the testing set and plot the training and testing sets with fitted lines.
5.Calculate error metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE) to evaluate the model’s performance.
## Program:
